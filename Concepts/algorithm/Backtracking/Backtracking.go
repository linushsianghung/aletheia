## Definition:
- Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates
to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
- Backtracking can be seen as an optimised way to brute force. Brute force approaches evaluate every possibility. In backtracking, you stop evaluating a possibility
as soon as it breaks some constraint provided in the problem, take a step back and keep trying other possible cases, see if those lead to a valid solution.
- Due to this backtracking behaviour, the backtracking algorithms are often much faster than the brute-force search algorithm since it eliminates many unnecessary explorations.

## Backtracking Problems:
> You are explicitly asked to return a collection of all answers.
> You are concerned with what the actual solutions are rather than say the most optimum value of some parameter. (if it were the latter, itâ€™s most likely DP or greedy).

- Backtracking v.s. DFS:
	- DFS + not visiting an invalid node => Backtracking.
	- DFS + not visiting node twice => Dynamic Programming. [let's ignore tabular for now]

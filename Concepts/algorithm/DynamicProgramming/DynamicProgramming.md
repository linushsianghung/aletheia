## Definition:
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a programming paradigm that can systematically and efficiently explore all possible solutions to a problem. As such, it is capable of
solving a wide variety of problems that often have the following characteristics:
1. The problem can be broken down into "overlapping sub-problems" - smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times.
2. The problem has an "optimal substructure" - an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping sub-problems of the original problem.

## Top-Down (Memoization) approach v.s. Bottom-Up (Tabulation) approach
Ref: https://www.enjoyalgorithms.com/blog/top-down-memoization-vs-bottom-up-tabulation
### Top-Down: implementation of naturally using recursion but modify it to save the solution of each sub-problem in an array or hash table,
then check whether it has previously solved the sub-problem
> Visualise the probelm as a tree
> Implement the tree using recursion
> Work in inefficient way
> Add a memo object (Array or Map)
> Add a base cast to return memo value
> Store the return value to memo
### Bottom-Up: an iterative version of the top-down approach where solution of any problem depends only on the solution of smaller sub-problems.
> Visualise the probelm as a table
> Size the table based on the inputs
> Initialise the table with default values
> Seed the trivial value into the table
> Iterate throught the table and fill further position based on the current position

``` Summary
A bottom-up implementation's runtime is usually faster, as iteration does not have the overhead that recursion does.
A top-down implementation is usually much easier to write because of recursion where the ordering of sub-problems does not matter, whereas with tabulation,
we need to go through a logical ordering of solving sub-problems.

Asymptotically, both of these approaches guarantee the same time complexity, except in unusual circumstances where the top-down approach does not actually
recurse to examine all possible sub-problems.

### How to Tackle Question:
1. Start with backtracking (top-down)
2. Add memoization table if possible (top-down)
3. Convert the memoization table into DP table if possible (bottom-up)
4. Go from DP table to DP array (or several) if possible (bottom-up)
5. Keep an eye on greedy solutions along the way as they are almost always better
